<collection-service>

	<startup-mode>Automatic</startup-mode>
		Startup mode of the service, can be either Manual or Automatic. In case
		of Manual mode, the service will be added to the list but will not be
		started, but in case of Automatic the service is started automatically
		when the server is started.
		Change in value requires service restart.

	<is-sorting-required>true</is-sorting-required>
		Is sorting required can be either true or false. If it is true then collection service 
		will do collection according to the sort order. Sorting is based on last modified date.
	
	<execution-interval>1</execution-interval>
		The Interval in terms of minutes after which the service will be started.

	<device-name>device-1</device-name>
		Path to which the files read from source path are to be placed under appropriate base directory.
		eg. If it is collection service , the collected raw files are placed under
		COLLECTION_ROOT/${device-name}/collected directory.

	<immediate-execute-on-startup>true</immediate-execute-on-startup>
		Contain the values 'True' or 'False' which represents that whether the
		service is to be started immediately on the startup of the mediation.

	<queue-size>1500</queue-size>
    	Maximum requests that can stay in the queue, any new request recevied
	    when the queue is full will be dropped.
	    Change in value requires soft restart of the service after reloading
	    the configuration.

	<minimum-thread>1</minimum-thread>
    	Minimum number of threads that should stay in the pool to handle the
    	request. All the threads will be created during initilization.
	    Change in value requires soft restart of the service after reloading
	    the configuration.

	<maximum-thread>1</maximum-thread>
    	Maximum number of threads that should be created during load.
	    Change in value requires soft restart of the service after reloading
	    the configuration.

    <file-batch-size>100</file-batch-size>
        Service will pick up these much files to process at a time.

	<add-file-name-prefix>new</add-file-name-prefix>
		This parameter will add the given value to file name as a prefix.
		
	<select-file-on-prefixes>new</select-file-on-prefixes>
		Only those file will collect who's prefix is new.
		
	<minimum-disk-space-required>-1</minimum-disk-space-required>
		This attributes is used to configured the disk space size in GB. If value of this tag is less then available disk space then & then 
		collection service will do further process othewise service will not pick up the file. 	
		
    <driver-list>
    
        List of dirvers configured for Collection Service

        <driver>
          Driver details.

            <application-order>1</application-order>
                The order in which the driver to be assigned the task.

            <driver-name>FTP_COLLECTION_DRIVER</driver-name>
                The name of the driver, must match to any of the name available
                in service mapping file (system-mapping.xml).

            <timeout>1000000</timeout>
                Timeout in milli seconds for driver process, if the driver fails to
                respond within this specified time, response will be given back
                without any ip allocation.

            <next-driver>false</next-driver>
                Can be used to specify whether to give the request that is successfully
                processed by this driver. If configured to true, on successful completion
                of process by this driver, the request will be given to next available
                driver and the response given by the next driver will be returned back
                to the client. In case next driver is not present, the response of current
                driver will be returned.
